# Minecraft_Modpack_Maker
A Minecraft modpack maker/patcher/updater for minecraft.

Wrote this quick and dirty JFRame application for installing modpacks.

It works by hosting your modpack on the web. It uses basic version checking in a text file to see if the modpack needs to be downloaded or not.

It then injects the modpack into your minecraft launcher.

When it works, it is a super easy, auto-updating auto-installing modpack installer, perfect for modpack makers.
